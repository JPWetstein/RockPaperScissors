RockPaperScissors
=================

A simple RPS game using sinatra

 * To use, simply type "ruby rps_home.rb" from the home directory
 * To run tests, type "ruby tests/rps_test.rb" from the home directory

A chose sinatra over rails for simplicity's sake, as a Rock, Paper, Scissors game doesn't require most of rail's features.
